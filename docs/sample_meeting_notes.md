## 1. Established Client (6 months)

**Meeting with Rajesh Sharma - Jan 28, 2026**

Had coffee with Rajesh at his office today. He mentioned his daughter Priya got into Stanford for her MBA - starts this fall. He's clearly proud but also thinking about the $200K+ cost. Said he'd rather pay outright than have her take loans. We should factor this into his liquidity planning.

On the investment side, he's getting more cautious. The volatility last quarter spooked him a bit - asked twice about "capital protection" options. I reminded him we're playing the long game but he's definitely more risk-averse than when we started. Worth revisiting his risk profile in our next formal review.

His manufacturing business is doing well - revenue up 15% YoY. Mentioned he's considering selling a minority stake to a PE firm in the next 2-3 years. Could be a significant liquidity event. He wants to keep this confidential for now.

Personal update: wife Sunita is recovering well from her knee surgery. They're planning a Europe trip in June - first real vacation in two years.

He asked about sustainable investing again. Third time now. I think he's serious about moving some allocation to ESG funds, especially after his nephew joined a climate tech startup.

Follow-up needed:
- Send him the education planning scenarios
- Schedule formal portfolio review for March
- Get him info on our ESG offerings

Next meeting: tentatively mid-Feb at the club.

## 2. First Meeting - New Prospect

**Initial Meeting with Ananya Krishnan - Jan 29, 2026**

Referral from Vikram Mehta. Ananya is a senior partner at Luthra & Luthra - corporate law. Mid-40s, divorced, one son (Arjun, 16).

She's currently with HDFC Private Banking but frustrated with the "product pushing." Looking for someone who'll actually listen. Her words: "I don't want to be sold to."

Assets under discussion: ~₹8-9 Cr liquid, plus a flat in Bandra she inherited. No clarity yet on her investment philosophy - she admitted she's been too busy to think about it properly. Said her ex-husband handled most of this before.

Immediate concerns:
- Son's education (looking at US/UK undergrad in 2 years)
- Her own retirement - wants to slow down by 55
- "Something for impact" - mentioned she's on the board of an education NGO

She's analytical, asks sharp questions. Will need data and rationale, not just recommendations.

Red flag: she mentioned a friend lost money in a PMS scheme. Trust will need to be earned slowly.

Sending her our onboarding questionnaire and capability deck. Second meeting scheduled for Feb 10.

## 3. Early Stage (2 months in)

**Call with Deepak & Meera Joshi - Jan 27, 2026**

Quick 30-min video call. They're settling into the relationship - less formal than our first few meetings.

Deepak confirmed they'll move the FDs maturing in March (~₹1.2 Cr) to us. Finally got sign-off from Meera - she was the hesitant one. She's still nervous about equity exposure but agreed to the 60-40 allocation we discussed.

Interesting detail: Meera manages day-to-day finances, Deepak handles investments. Need to make sure I'm keeping her in the loop - she mentioned feeling "out of the loop" with their previous advisor.

They're expecting their first grandchild in April (daughter's pregnant). Deepak joked about starting a "grandchildren fund" - I think he's half serious. Could be a good way to introduce SIPs.

Still pending:
- Insurance review (Deepak keeps postponing)
- Nomination updates on their existing holdings

They're going to Goa for two weeks in Feb. Will reconnect after.

## 4. Mid-term Client - Life Event

**Emergency call with Suresh Nair - Jan 28, 2026**

Suresh called at 8pm, very stressed. His father passed away yesterday - sudden cardiac arrest. I offered condolences and told him to focus on family, but he wanted to talk through some things.

His father had substantial assets that Suresh and his brother will inherit. Rough estimate: house in Chennai (~₹3 Cr), FDs (~₹80L), and some old shares he's not even sure about. Father didn't keep great records. Suresh is the executor.

He's worried about:
- Estate/succession - what paperwork is needed
- His brother (they don't get along) - wants clean division
- Tax implications of inheritance

I told him inheritance isn't taxed but gains on sale would be. Promised to connect him with our estate planning partner next week.

More personally: this has made him think about his own mortality. He's 52, hasn't updated his will since his kids were small. Mentioned wanting to "get his house in order."

Expect his risk appetite and priorities to shift. Parking this for now - will revisit in a month once things settle. Sent him a condolence note and the estate planning checklist.

## 5. Long-term Client (3+ years)

**Quarterly review with the Mehtas - Jan 25, 2026**

Anil and Shalini came to the office for our regular review. These meetings run themselves now - they trust the process.

Portfolio is up 14% YTD, ahead of benchmark. Anil barely glanced at the numbers - "You handle it, that's why we pay you." His focus has completely shifted to his art collection. Spent 20 minutes showing me photos from an auction in Dubai. He's getting serious about this - mentioned pieces worth ₹40-50L each.

Need to think about:
- Art as an asset class in his overall allocation
- Insurance for the collection
- Potentially connecting him with art advisory services

Shalini brought up their Goa property again. They're now leaning toward selling rather than renovating. Market is good. If they sell, that's another ₹5-6 Cr to deploy.

Their son Rohan (the one who was "finding himself" in Bali) is apparently launching a D2C brand. Anil rolled his eyes but said they'd probably invest ₹50L as seed. Asked me if I knew anyone in the startup space who could advise. I'll ask around.

No changes to allocation. Next review in April. Dinner at their place next month - Shalini insisted.

## 6. Difficult Conversation - Underperformance

**Meeting with Kavitha Raman - Jan 29, 2026**

Tough one. Kavitha came in upset about her portfolio performance. She's down 8% in the mid-cap allocation while "her cousin's advisor" apparently delivered 20% returns.

I walked her through the numbers:
- Her overall portfolio is up 6% (she was only looking at one segment)
- The mid-cap correction affected everyone
- We deliberately stayed away from the small-cap rally because of her stated risk tolerance

She acknowledged this but I could tell she wasn't fully satisfied. Classic case of comparing returns without comparing risk. Her cousin is probably in much more volatile stuff.

What I'm sensing: she's getting advice from too many sources - cousin, colleagues, WhatsApp groups. This creates noise and second-guessing.

Action items:
- Send her a consolidated view showing total returns since inception (she's actually up 34% over 2 years)
- Schedule a call to revisit her goals and risk tolerance - maybe she actually wants more aggressive exposure now
- Need to rebuild confidence - suggest monthly check-in calls for the next quarter

Note to self: don't get defensive. Listen more. She's not wrong to ask questions - that's healthy. The relationship is fine, just needs attention.
