    "note": "First formal profiling call (existing social relationship). Client based in Mumbai; resident. Prefers WhatsApp for quick pings and calls for decisions; prefers afternoons. Married; spouse is a co-decision-maker for large allocations. Self-employed/business owner in real estate (development and leasing); income 2Cr+ but lumpy/deal-based. Expects potential large inflow from a project exit in ~6–9 months (not guaranteed) and wants options lined up early. Expenses 5L+; surplus varies; says emergency buffer is ample but did not quantify; keeps cash and liquid funds. Has multiple liabilities including project loans; did not want details on first call; says manageable. Goals include wealth creation and creating passive income streams; curious about succession structuring but not urgent. Comfortable with lock-ins if compensated; open to AIF/PMS and select structured ideas but wants transparency and no opaque terms; moderate-to-high interest in international exposure. Wants to avoid traditional insurance pitches. Prefers large selective lump sums (25L+); SIP not relevant. Decisioning: wants RM to curate and provide a crisp thesis; fast decisions if trust is high. Switching from previous advisor due to perceived in-house product pushing. Risk behavior: tends to add during drawdowns; dislikes surprises from hidden liquidity or terms. PAN/KYC not shared today; will share via office; KYC not started formally. Next follow-up planned for 2026-01-07 to explain AIF/PMS basics and term-sheet red flags, begin KYC, and confirm liquidity preference bands and constraints."

    "note": "First call after cold outreach conversion. Client based in Pune; resident. Prefers calls and uses WhatsApp only for confirmations; prefers mornings; language Marathi/English. Widowed with one adult child abroad; child is consulted but not primary decision-maker. Retired (former government/education administration); income from pension and interest; estimated annual income 10–25L based on description. Monthly expenses in <50k–1L range; small investable surplus 25k–50k plus an existing corpus in bank FDs. Very conservative with 12+ months emergency buffer; no liabilities. Primary goals are capital preservation and monthly income comfort; also wants to earmark funds for travel/visits. High liquidity preference and does not want lock-ins. Product preference leans to FDs/bonds and conservative funds; open to mutual funds if explained simply; no ESG preference and no international exposure desired. Very trust-sensitive due to past mis-sold insurance; skeptical of market-linked products; needs education and very small first step. Needs basics on mutual funds, risk, and reading statements; prefers simple summaries and slow decision pace. Risk behavior: previously exited equity quickly during volatility; formal risk questionnaire should be handled gently. PAN/KYC status unknown; she will check and send; KYC not started. Next follow-up planned for 2026-01-09 to explain 2–3 low-risk options (FD ladder, short-duration debt, conservative hybrid), request basic KYC documents, and propose a tiny pilot allocation to build comfort."
